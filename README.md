# European Soccer Match Outcome Prediction

“I get nervous before the games because soccer is not mathematics, it’s completely unpredictable. That’s what makes it so popular.” - *Arsène Wenger, manager of ‘Premier League’ club Arsenal*

Soccer is a fast-growing multibillion dollar industry being the most watched and participated sport worldwide. Thus, with it's growing popularity, the growth in online gambling on soccer matches has grown even more rapidly over the last years. There are many commercial services that make predicting soccer matches their primary business. They utilize data about previous matches, team performance, and players to make their predictions. They use various software programs and algorithms to aid their data tracking. Furthermore, they utilize the advice of experts in the area as part of their predictions. What if there was a way to build a model that could accurately predict the outcome of soccer matches? Although Arsène Wenger asserted that soccer is not mathematics, statistics will be used in this project to come up with models that predict the outcome of soccer matches using the dataset at [European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)
